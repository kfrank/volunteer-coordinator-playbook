His goal is to one day be on the board and is trying to work his way up by being friendly and knowing the ins and outs of how the club works. At the open house, Susan, the volunteer coordinator, gave him the task of following up with people who just finished curling. He decided to make a fun activity out of it by putting people into groups and having them chat with experienced curlers while playing games in the bar. Because they stuck around longer, Zach was able to follow up with every one of them to answer their questions and got more people interested in joining the club than at a typical open house event. Susan felt great about this and is now thinking about letting Zach be the coordinator for future open houses.","type":"child","image":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/day-of-event/07-empower-others/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/day-of-event/06-designate-a-goto-person/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Designate a “Go-To” person or event leader"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/day-of-event/08-dont-wait-for-volunteers/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Don’t wait for volunteers to come to you"}}}}}
