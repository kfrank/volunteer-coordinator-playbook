calloutText: "The holiday spiel was finally over the last participants had come off the ice to grab their winnings, the kitchen was clean and the decor taken care off. As planned Brian gathered the bonspiel leaders and key volunteers in the club bar to have a short post-mortem. Everyone grabbed something to drink and a bag of chips materialized. In addition to the event leaders Brian had asked the bonspiel chair from the board to come as well. The group relaxed, enjoying each otherâ€™s company as they got ready to discuss the event."

Ideally you will have communicated about the post-mortem meeting with your leadership group in advance of the event. If at all possible just plan to stay 1-2 hours after the event concludes to quickly run through what you learned.

**Key things to remember:**

- Set the time and day in advance.
- Pick a place where you can have food and drinks.
- Invite the full event leadership team and any key volunteers. Send out a couple of key questions to discuss in advance.
  - Were event communications handled in an efficient and effective manner?
  - What went well?
  - What unexpected issues came up?
  - What could be done in the future to improve the event?
