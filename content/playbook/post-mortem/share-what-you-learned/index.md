Make sure your meeting has a note-taker, prepare for the meeting and bring along some paper and a pen for your note-taker or if you get a note-taker in advance ask them to bring their laptop. Try not to have the meeting facilitator also serving as the note-taker, it is easier to concentrate on conversation
and group participation when you are not also trying to take notes. Share the outcome with the board chair responsible for the area your event was associated with.

**Record the following:**

- Any issues with the event.
- All event wins.
- Any recommendations for future events.
- Next steps and action items.
