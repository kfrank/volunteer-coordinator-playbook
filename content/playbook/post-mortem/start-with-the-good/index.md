calloutText: "At the Granite Curling Club, Robert got together a group of volunteers to clean up the yard and parking lot outside as well as do gardening to spruce things up. Since it was an unusually hot summer day in Seattle, Robert made sure to have a cooler full of cold water and drinks available and specifically told individual volunteers to take breaks for as long as they needed. Because their basic needs were taken care of, Robertâ€™s volunteers were so happy with this experience that almost all of them decided to volunteer again the following month."

Your crew just put in hours if not days and weeks planning and pulling off the event, start by celebrating that you made it across the finish line. People will naturally want to start digging into what went wrong or could be improved because those types of inputs make more of an impression on us during the event. Your job as the leader is to get the post-mortem started out on the right foot and celebrate the successes.

**Key things to remember:**

- During the event planning make note of things that went well
- While the event is underway keep track of highlights
- Bring your highlight list to the post-mortem
- Let the group know you are going to spend the first 20 minutes celebrating what went well
- If people start to go low and focus on what went wrong first, go high and model how to focus on successes
