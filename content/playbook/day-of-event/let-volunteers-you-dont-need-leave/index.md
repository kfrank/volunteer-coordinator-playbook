Sometimes it’s hard to know how many volunteers you’ll actually need. If you’ve overestimated, volunteers may be standing around unsure of what to do next, how they can help out, or if they’ll be ok ending their volunteer time that day.

- **If you see volunteers standing around with nothing to do, let them know they can be done and either stick around and enjoy themselves or leave.**
- **If volunteers insist on staying to help out, see if coordinators in other areas need any extra assistance.**
