calloutText: "Thomas was two hours into his four hour shift volunteering to wash dishes for the holiday spiel and let’s just say the thrill was gone. No matter how fast he washed dishes it seemed like the kitchen crew was getting them dirty again. Just about the time that Thomas was thinking he had made a mistake volunteering Bill the bonspiel manager came into the kitchen and made it a point to thank Thomas again for the hard work he was doing to help make the event a success. Bill checked to see if anyone in the kitchen needed anything, had stories of the compliments he was hearing for the food, and let the group know that this might be some of the best food ever. Thomas was invigorated by the attention and compliments and was able to keep powering through the dishes."

It feels good to be needed! Setting volunteers up for success happens all throughout your communication with them. Don’t wait until the event is over to show your appreciation.

- **Set volunteers up for a great day by thanking them for coming when they walk through the door.**
- **While work is underway, take time to offer thanks especially if someone is working on a thankless task.**
