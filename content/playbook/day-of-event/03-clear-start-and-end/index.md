Volunteers need to plan their schedule or travel to and from the event. Giving them clear times helps set them up for what to expect.

- **Confirm when they arrive how long you expect them to be present and able to help out.**
- **Post a schedule for the roles so volunteers know who is coming to relieve them.**
- **When a role has a flexible start and end time, make sure volunteers know to check in with you before they come in the event the work is already done.**
