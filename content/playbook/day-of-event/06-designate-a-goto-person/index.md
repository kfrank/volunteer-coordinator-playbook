It helps to know who when a volunteer has a question they’ll get an answer from the right person and not shuffled around delaying their task.

- **When you start the event, tell volunteers who are in charge so they know where to ask questions.**
- **Set up multiple people as volunteer leaders if your event is large or takes place in multiple locations.**
