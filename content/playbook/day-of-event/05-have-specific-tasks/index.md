calloutText: "Kathy was excited and nervous to do her first volunteer shift with the Adaptive Curling Clinic. The day before the event she got an email from Yolanda reminding her to plan to get to the event 30 minutes early so that she could attend a quick training. Included with the reminder were a couple of links to videos on how
to instruct wheelchair curling. Kathy watched the videos and came early the next day ready to learn. Yolanda had time set aside to answer any of Kathy’s questions. After training was done Kathy was assigned to work with Tim on Sheet 5 with 4 guests. Kathy’s role was to position the rocks for the wheelchair and chat with the guests. Kathy gained a lot of confidence getting to work with Tim and see how he instructed."

Volunteers like to know what they’re supposed to do. It’s not enough to tell them to “make themselves useful” because not everyone knows what that means
to you.

- **Give volunteers clear tasks so they can feel confident and accomplished.**
- **Send out instructions in advance when possible. Bring a printed copy of instructions.**
- **Provide a follow-up task as a bonus they can do if they finish the first one quickly.**
