Volunteers like to know what they’re supposed to do. It’s not enough to tell them to “make themselves useful” because not everyone knows what that means to you.

- Give volunteers clear tasks so they can feel confident and accomplished.

- Provide a follow-up task as a bonus they can do if they finish the first one quickly.
