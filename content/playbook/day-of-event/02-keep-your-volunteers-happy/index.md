calloutText: "At the Granite Curling Club, Robert got together a group of volunteers to clean up the yard and parking lot outside as well as do gardening to spruce things up. Since it was an unusually hot summer day in Seattle, Robert made sure to have a cooler full of cold water and drinks available and specifically told individual volunteers to take breaks for as long as they needed. Because their basic needs were taken care of, Robert’s volunteers were so happy with this experience that almost all of them decided to volunteer again the following month."
