Your volunteers may encounter a tough situation they canâ€™t easily solve and feel uncomfortable and unsure of what to do next. These situations can often be the most frustrating for volunteers.

- **Having a plan in place will help volunteers feel more comfortable and willing to continue to volunteer in the future.**
- **Have someone more experienced nearby new volunteers can easily see and ask for help.**
- **Let the new volunteers know this is the person they can ask for help.**
- **Keep a list of key club contacts in case of ice or warm room emergencies.**
- **Try to have one volunteer with first aid training per shift. For key roles consider assigning back ups.**
