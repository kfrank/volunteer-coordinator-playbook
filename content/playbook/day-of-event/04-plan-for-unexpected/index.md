Your volunteers may encouter a tough situation they can’t easily solve and feel uncomfortable and unsure of what to do next. These situations can often be the most frustrating for volunteers.  Having a plan in place will help volunteers feel more comfortable and willing to continue to volunteer in the future.

- Have someone more experienced nearby new volunteers can easily see and ask for help.

- Let the new volunteers know this is the person they can ask for help.
