Some volunteers may not be as comfortable asking for help when they need it or be as extroverted to seek out assistance immediately.

- Seek them out to make sure they’re doing ok, comfortable with a task, or need anything extra.

- If you see someone struggling with a task, have an event leader come over to give them extra motivation or another pair of hands.
