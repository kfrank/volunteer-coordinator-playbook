Some volunteers may not be as comfortable asking for help when they need it or be as extroverted to seek out assistance immediately.

- **Seek them out to make sure theyâ€™re doing ok, comfortable with a task, or need anything extra.**
- **If you see someone struggling with a task, have an event leader come over to give them extra motivation or another pair of hands.**
