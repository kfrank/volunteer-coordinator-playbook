Above all else, volunteers just want to have fun! Make it a great experience by trying some of these things:

- Consider making parts of the volunteer activity a fun competition between friends, like “first to complete X gets bragging rights!”

- Consider a fun celebration of your choosing upon completion of the event, for example a cheer, round of drinks or a reward like a patch or sticker that gives a sense of “social credibility”.
