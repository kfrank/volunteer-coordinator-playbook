calloutText: "At the Granite Curling Club, cliques naturally form together. It’s common to see the same people hanging out together. Katie and Jacob were new members looking to make friends at the curling club. They weren’t having much lunch breaking into social circles until Katie volunteered them both to help out at a bonspiel event. Katie ended up being in the kitchen helping with lunch prep and made new friends she later introduced Jacob to. Now both of them know more people, get invited to more activities and feel even more welcomed at the club."

One of the main motivators for volunteers is meeting new people and making new friends! Making a new friend helps volunteers have a positive experience and encourages them to sign up for events in the future.

- **Don’t always have the same people working together; add someone new who you think might have fun!**
- **On the day of the volunteer activity, coordinate a round of introductions between the volunteers by asking them to introduce themselves and answer a fun ice breaker question.**
