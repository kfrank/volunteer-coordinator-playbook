Before recruiting volunteers, it is important to review the volunteer roles you want to fill ahead of time to make sure your team hasnâ€™t missed something. This information can be pulled from past events, or built from the ground up. Review the following steps to help you prepare for recruitment:

- Organize Your Intel (20 mins)

  - Write out all of the tasks that you need volunteers to complete
  - Group the similar tasks together to form specific volunteer roles
  - Add titles to those roles

- Team up (10 mins)

  - Look at each role and ask yourself: How many people do you need in total for this role?
  - _Hint: Consider number of volunteer shifts and amount of work_

- Write it out (2 mins per role)
