calloutText: "Hesitant Harriet is considering volunteering at her local curling club’s next event, but she is not entirely sure what being a volunteer means. She opens the event sign up sheet to investigate, and sees the roles and time slots clearly spelled out. She notices there is an open role on the event set up team and she reads role description under the title. She sees she needs to be familiar with power tools for this role. Harriet loves power tools! Suddenly excited by the challenges ahead, she signs up  to volunteer for the 2-hour slot on Sunday because she knows her partner will be able to watch the kids at that time.

A good sign-up sheet doesn’t just tell you who is interested in volunteering. It acts as a tool for the volunteers themselves, and if crafted well it can ease volunteer worries and encourage more sign ups.

The sign up sheet should...

- Be easy to find

  - Include volunteer role descriptions
  - Allow sign up by time slot

- Consider using an existing tool

  - A Spreadsheet template
  - A digital tool such as SignUp Genius
