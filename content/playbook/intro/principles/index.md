We've taken all our research and distilled it down to six principles volunteer-run organizations should be guided by to increase their success. Think of them as "common sense, not common practice", and learn to actively incorporate them into your organization's work.

## Volunteering should...

- **Feel like fun not work**
- **Be rooted in a welcoming community**
- **Have a low barrier to participation by being approachable, not overwhelming or scary**
- **Encourage a learn as you go and continuous training mindset**

## Volunteer Coordinators should...

- **Engage in shared documentation to build upon previous work**
- **Communicate volunteering opportunities, expectations, and schedules early & often**
