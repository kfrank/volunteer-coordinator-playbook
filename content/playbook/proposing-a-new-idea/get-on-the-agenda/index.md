Find out when the board or leadership regularly meets. Usually, the times and dates for the board meetings are posted in advance on a calendar. Work with your board contact to determine when you should come and present your idea. It may also be that the board member can present the idea for you if you prefer not to speak in front of a group.

- **Pick a date when you will be ready to share the details of your idea.**
- **Request a spot on the board meeting agenda.**
- **Send the details of your idea to the board in advance of the meeting.**
- **Donâ€™t worry the board meetings are casual events.**
