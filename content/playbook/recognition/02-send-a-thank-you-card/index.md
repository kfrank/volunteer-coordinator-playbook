calloutText: "Jet got home from a long day at work and was surprised to see a hand-addressed card waiting in their mailbox for them. They opened the card and saw that it was a thank you note from Joan for the work that they had done last month on the club bar towel washing crew. Jet had been covering for Jen while she was on vacation and they had been washing towels twice a week to ensure that the club had enough towels for the bar and kitchen. Joan had sent a note to acknowledge the extra work Jet was putting in."
