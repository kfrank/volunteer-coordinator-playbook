## Make sure your volunteers come back!

At Granite Curling Club where everyone is a volunteer it is easy to lose track of the need to recognize and thank people for the work that they do. Spending the time to acknowledge the time volunteers spend, their achievements and overall impact to the club is important. People want to know that they are making a difference in the community. As a volunteer event leader it is important that you dig deep and make the extra effort to recognize those that have come to help.
