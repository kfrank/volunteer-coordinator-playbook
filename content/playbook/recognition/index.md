## Make sure your volunteers come back!

When everyone is a volunteer it is easy to lose track of the need to recognize and thank people for the work that they do. Spending the time to acknowledge the time volunteers spend, their achievements, and overall impact on the organization is important. People want to know that they are making a difference in the community. As a volunteer event leader, it is important that you dig deep and make the extra effort to recognize those that have come to help.
