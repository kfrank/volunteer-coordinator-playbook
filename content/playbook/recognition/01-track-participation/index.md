Ideally the volunteer sign up sheets for the event should do most of the tracking for you. Pay attention to last minute volunteers or day of individuals who may not have officially signed up to help. The purpose of tracking participation is to make sure the club can demonstrate the impact of our volunteers and recognize them specifically.

**Tips to remember:**

- Print out the volunteer sign up list and bring it to the event or pull up to reference during the event.
- Encourage last minute volunteers to sign up on the sheet even retroactively.
- Thank people for signing up.
- Add people to the list who did not sign up themselves.
- Should someone need to drop out or be unable to serve their shift make a note of that as well.
