calloutText: "Jessica wanted to try out a new bonspiel format to address barriers to team formation that were found during a UW study of adult team formation at GCC. Jessica approached Todd and Ethan two experienced bonspiel leaders and asked if they would be willing to help her with the project. Now with a leadership group assembled and confident that she could pull off the event, Jessica wroted down a short description of what she wanted to do."

So you say you have an idea? Great, we want to know all about it. Take some time to first write up a short description of your idea and be as specific as possible. Writing down your event idea will help you think through the logistics and prepare you to answer questions from the board on what you want to do.

**When writing your description, try to think about:**

- What problem are you solving?
- What opportunity have you identified?
- Why is this important?
- How will this idea help advance the purpose of the organization?

| Launch a new curling tournament format designed to provide a low barrier to bonspiel participation. Take the bonspiel team formation barrier findings and use them to create an individual sign up spiel at the beginning of the season to allow club members to meet new people and form teams for future events. Replace the 25 and Under Spiel with the new format to encourage higher levels of club member participation. |
