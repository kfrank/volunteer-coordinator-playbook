calloutText: "To propose changes to the bonspiel formats, contact the Bonspiel chair via email and send them your idea description to see what their reaction to the idea is. If the reaction is positive ask for the opportunity to present your idea at the next board meeting. Board meetings occur each month, make sure you are presenting your idea a minimum of 3 months before it would occur to allow for proper planning. Often it is best to approach the board with ideas for the following season.  The Club calendar meeting is held in March to set the calendar for the following season."

When presenting your idea to the GCC board for consideration, make sure your idea is getting to the right person or people. A list of club volunteer board members and leaders can be found on the [Club Contact page](https://www.curlingseattle.org/contacts).
