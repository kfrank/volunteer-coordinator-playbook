calloutText: "Bill is excited to present his idea for setting up an online curling shirt store as a junior fundraiser to the board. He spent some time working with the junior curling board member to help organize his idea and think about the types of questions the board might ask. He found a couple of artists at the club who are willing to donate curling t-shirt art and a site where he can set up the online store with no financial investment needed from the club. Bill presents his idea and answers
a few questions, the board votes and approves Bill to move forward with the concept and report back after a couple of months to let the board know how the fundraiser is going."
