calloutText: "Pat has a vision for transforming the weedy flower beds in front of the curling club into well manicured planters by assembling a work crew to help him clear the beds, lay down landscape cloth and then a layer of bark to make sure that the weeds donâ€™t come back. Pat wrote up his idea and then sent an email to the buildings and facilities contact about the idea. When Pat and the buildings and facilities contact were next at the club together they made a point to grab a beer in the bar and discuss the idea further."
