To allow for growth and engagement it is critical to allow volunteer leaders to propose new volunteer events for your organization. Make it easy for members to see what the process to get an event approved is. Create a formalized process but take care to not make it too formal, you want to encourage and welcome ideas from the people who have the passion to get the work done.
