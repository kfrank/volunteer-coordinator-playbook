The idea is out of your head and people are reacting well to it. Now it is time to take it to the next level and really start to think about everything that it will take to make your idea a reality.

Here are some good questions to think through:

- Description: What your event is?
- Timeline: When you plan to have the event occur?
- Budget: Roughly how much will the event cost? How much revenue will the event produce?
- Club responsibility: What type of financial support do you need from the club? What type of facility support do you need?
- Estimated level of effort: How much time will it take to accomplish your goal?
- Estimated number of volunteers needed: How much help do you need to pull this off?
- Qualifications/Past Experience: What have you done in the past that qualifies you to lead this event?

Write down your answers to these questions, it does not need to be anything fancy a simple email will work. The main thing is to make sure that you have considered how you are going to make this idea a reality once you get approved.
