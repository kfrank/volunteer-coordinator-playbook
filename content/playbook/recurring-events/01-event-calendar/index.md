Key to engaging new volunteer coordinators is publicizing opportunities well in advance, the **recommended time is 6 months before the event will occur**. The Granite Curling Club maintains a Google calendar to schedule events at the club. When events are approved by the board and scheduled the club calendar is updated.

Each event calendar listing should include the following minimum details:

| Recommended Details          |                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Event Title:**             | Knock the Dust Off Speil                                                                          |
| **Event Dates:**             | Friday October 23rd 6:30pm - Sunday October 25th 2:00pm                                           |
| **Event Coordinator(s):**    | Open positions inquire with [volunteers@curlingseattle.org](mailto:volunteers@curlingseattle.org) |
| **Volunteer Opportunities:** | [Volunteer Sign Up](http://)                                                                      |
| **Event Details:**           | [Bonspiel Listing](http://)                                                                       |

- Only list club emails and not personal member emails on the public calendar listing
- Provide coordinator contact information on the volunteer sign up page
- Update the listing as the event coordinator role(s) are filled
- For recurring events maintain a list of standard volunteer roles and post the opportunities at the same time the event is added to the calendar

Ideally each event should be used as an opportunity to train new volunteer event coordinators, pair experienced event coordinators with a new event coordinator. Leverage the calendar posting to drive interest to both the event and volunteer sign ups.
