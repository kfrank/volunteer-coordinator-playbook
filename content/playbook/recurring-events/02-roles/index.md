calloutText: "Jill volunteers as a league manager at the Granite Curling Club, she has been managing her league for several years and recently took on Roger, a new club member, as her back up league manager. When it comes time to form new league teams for the 2nd half of the season Jill invites her backup Roger over for dinner to be a part of the process when she is forming teams. Jill is able to lean on Rogers’ knowledge of new club members as she makes the teams and Roger learns what it takes to build balanced teams for a managers choice league. Jill and Roger schedule themselves to be on different draws so that they can make sure there is always a leader around to make announcements and
answer questions."

Always be on the lookout for your next great volunteer leader. One way to maximize the volunteer leaders in your organization is to use each event as an opportunity to train new volunteer event coordinators. When you can pair an experienced leader with a leader in training as their backup to learn the ropes of putting on the event.

**People can’t sign up for what they don’t know about:**

- Let your leaders know that opportunities are on the calendar.
- Get to know your club members and the types of roles they enjoy doing.
- Provide detailed information about volunteer roles available.
- For complicated events, schedule a committee kick-off meeting for a minimum of 3 months in advance.
- Encourage volunteers to have a backup that they are training to lead in the future.
