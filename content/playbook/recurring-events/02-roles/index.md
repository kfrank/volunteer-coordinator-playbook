Key to engaging new volunteers is making detailed information about volunteer roles available.

- For bonspiels schedule event kick-off for a minimum of 3 months in advance
- Estimate the time commitment based on previous volunteer experiences
- Monthly events would have a season kick off and may have quarterly kickoffs to engage new volunteers
- List all volunteer leadership roles for the event
- As roles are filled, update the page
