title: "Start With The Good"
---

Your crew just put in hours if not days and weeks planning and pulling off the event, start by celebrating that you made it across the finish line. People will naturally want to start digging into what went wrong or could be improved because those types of inputs make more of an impression on us during the event. Your job as the leader is to get the post-mortem started out on the right foot and celebrate the successes.

**Key things to remember:**

- During the event planning make note of things that went well
- While the event is underway, keep track of highlights
- Bring your highlight list to the post-mortem
- Let the group know you are going to spend the first 20 minutes celebrating what went well
- If people start to go low and focus on what went wrong first, go high and model how to focus on successes
