calloutText: "Brian and his team discussed what could be improved for the next bonspiel and they realized that the process of waiting to submit receipts all at once for reimbursement made it so that whoever was purchasing decorations would need to sit on the expenses for potentially months. The group brainstormed ideas and came up with a proposal for the treasurer board chair to allow for monthly reimbursement as long as the receipts were all submitted through the bonspiel manager so that they were tracked correctly against the budget. Brian documented the idea and took on the responsibility of talking about it with the treasurer. The group was energized that they had come up with a potential solution to a problem and kept talking about ways to improve."

When you look at what could be improved for next time, be careful to not allow participants to slide into a blame game. Acknowledge that everyone worked hard and wanted the event to be a success. Try to take a blame-free approach to catalog what you would change for the next time you run the event.

**Key things to remember:**

- Timebox the conversation let the group know they have 20 minutes to discuss what could be improved.
- This is not about who did something wrong. Focus on what went wrong and why.
- Don’t dwell on the bad or belabor the point, discuss enough to get to understanding but keep the conversation moving forward.
- Keep track of who shares and don’t allow the loud personalities to monopolize the conversation.
