## What to do after your event is over

Whether you just finished the best event ever or barely clawed your way across the finish line, assessing the event you just hosted with your volunteer leaders will help make sure the event runs even better the next time. Even though you will be tired, donâ€™t wait too long to host the post-mortem the closer you are to the event the better your recall of what happened will be.
