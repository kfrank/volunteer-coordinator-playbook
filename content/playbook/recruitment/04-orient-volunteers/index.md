This is the first time she has signed up to volunteer and she is not sure what to expect. Luckily Coordinator Cal sends her an email a few days after signing up reminding her of her roles and volunteer time. In addition Cal suggests she joins the volunteer mixer, scheduled the day before the event so she can meet other volunteers and get a better sense of what to expect. After reading the email Nelly breathes a sigh of relief. She let’s Cal know she will be at the event. She is excited to volunteer and make new friends!

Volunteers have signed up for your event (yay!) - now it’s time to give them a shout out and make sure they feel part of the team/ know what’s going on.

- Send out a welcome email

  - Reiterate the role expectation
  - Remind them of the shift time
  - Thank them for signing up

###Volunteers - Unite! The Pre-event Mixer:

Consider gathering the volunteers virtually or in-person before the day of the event. The event can be as short or as long as you would like. The event should include:

1. Nametags that include name as well as volunteer role
2. Introductions
3. Snacks & drinks (if in-person)
4. Mingling
