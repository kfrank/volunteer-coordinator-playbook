calloutText: "Nelly just signed up to volunteer for an event at her curling club for the first time and she’s not sure what to expect. Luckily, Cal sends her an email a few days after signing up reminding her of her roles and volunteer time. Cal also suggests she joins the volunteer mixer the day before the event so she can meet other volunteers and get a better sense of what to expect. After reading the email Nelly breathes a sigh of relief and is excited to volunteer and make new friends!"

Volunteers have signed up for your event (yay!) – now it’s time to give them a shout out and make sure they feel part of the team/ know what’s going on. Keep up a consistent thread of communication with the volunteers to keep them engaged as the days leading up to the event.

**Send out a welcome email within a couple of days of sign up:**

- Reiterate the role expectation.
- Remind them of the shift time.
- Thank them for signing up.

**Consider gathering the volunteers virtually or in-person before the event. The event can be as short or as long as you would like. The event should include:**

- Name tags that include volunteer role
- Introductions
- Instructions
- Snacks & drinks (if in-person)
- Mingling
