calloutText: "Leonard wants to get more involved in volunteering at his local curling club to build friendships and contribute to a cause about which he is passionate. He has volunteered a couple of times at the club in the past, but only because his friend told him about the events. His friend is not involved in the organization anymore so he is not sure how to sign up. He sees a flyer in the club bathroom about upcoming volunteer opportunities. Eureka! He makes note of it and plans to sign up when he gets home. Later that evening Leonard is home, watching his favorite TV show, volunteer sign-ups totally forgotten. He gets an email notification on his phone and notices it is from the curling club. He remembers the flyer and eagerly opens the email. He follows the link included in the email to the sign-up page. He reads the volunteer role descriptions and finds an open role that fits his schedule and interests. He signs up!"

You have identified the help you need now it is time to start getting the word
out. We recommend you start advertising the volunteer opportunity at least 3 months before the event. Some people will wait for the last minute to sign up but others plan out their schedules in advance and appreciate being able to prioritize helping at GCC. Think about the diversity at the club and plan several ways to let people know about your opportunity.

**Regularly remind club members about open volunteer opportunities:**

- Select at least one digital and physical method to use for recruitment.
- Use at least one method a week to boost awareness.
- Have weekly check-ins to assess which methods are working best.
- Try out new methods if the one you decided on isn't working.
