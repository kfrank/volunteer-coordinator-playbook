Before recruiting volunteers, it is important to review the volunteer roles you want to fill ahead of time to make sure everyone is covered. This information can be pulled from past events, or built from the ground up. Review the following steps to help you prepare for recruitment:

- **Organize Your Intel (20 mins)**

  - Write out all of the tasks that you need volunteers to complete.
  - Group similar tasks together to form specific volunteer roles.
  - Add titles to those roles.

- **Team up (10 mins)**

  - Look at each role and ask yourself: How many people do you need in total for this role?
  - _Hint: Consider the number of volunteer shifts and amount of work_

- **Write it out (2 mins per role)**

  - Title of role
  - The expected amount of time commitment
  - Things this volunteer will be expected to do (3-5 short bullet points)
  - Skills & training required (even if the answer is none)

**_Save these role descriptions for future events!_**
