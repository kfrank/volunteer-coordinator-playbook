calloutText: "Since 2002 Granite Curling Club has been running a 5 and Under Bonspiel. In 2013 when Chris volunteered to run the event he inherited a bunch of paper, a couple of excel workbooks and a whole lot of history. Wanting to make it easier for future coordinators, he took the time to document the history of the event along with steps to coordinate each part of the bonspiel. Now the club maintains a google drive where each aspect of how to run this unique event is stored."

Determine your plan for how you are going to keep your lead team organized and on the same page. If this is your first time leading an event or the first event of this type, reach out to others who have done it before you to see what they can share. You donâ€™t want to recreate the wheel when leading an event anytime you can use what has worked before. Also plan to pay it forward and keep track of the changes you make and new documents your team creates.

- Create a shared drive to store event planning materials.
- Establish a folder for each lead to use.
- Agree upon communication protocol (email vs slack).
- Leverage existing templates.
- Create new templates as needed.
- Document the steps you took.
- Centralize budget tracking and receipt upload.
