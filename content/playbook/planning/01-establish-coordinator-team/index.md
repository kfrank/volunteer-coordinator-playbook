- 4 months in advance, meet with the volunteer chair to determine the level of complexity for the event
- Work with the volunteer chair to recruit a novice co-coordinator who you can train to lead similar events in the future
- For each area of the club that will be used, recruit a leader for the volunteers in that area.
- Ideally have each of these roles identified 3 months before the event is scheduled

For example consider the leads for the Knock the Dust Off Bonspiel:
