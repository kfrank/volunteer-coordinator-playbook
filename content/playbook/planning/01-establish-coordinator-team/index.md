Assemble your squad to help pull off your event as soon as you can. A good leadership group means you can divide up the work and trust each other to pull off a great event.

- Determine the level of complexity of the event.
- Calculate how many leads you will need.
- Recruit your leads, get the word out that you are looking for help.
- Consider recruiting a new leader as your backup to train to lead similar events in the future.
- Ideally, fill your lead roles 3 months before the event.
- It is possible but not ideal for one person to have multiple lead roles for an event.
