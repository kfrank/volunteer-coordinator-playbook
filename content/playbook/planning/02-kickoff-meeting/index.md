Start off your event lead team with a gathering. A key motivator for volunteering is hanging out with fellow club members and establishing new friendships. It is important to mix business with pleasure, keep the event casual with a purpose and have a structured agenda.

Work with your volunteer leads to create a community around the event planning.

- **Ideally meet over a meal at your home or in the curling club bar.**
- **Get to know your leads and build rapport.**
- **Build a shared sense of mission.**
- **Target date is 3 months before the event.**
