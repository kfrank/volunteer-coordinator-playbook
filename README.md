# About the Volunteer Coordinator Playbook

This Playbook is a **working prototype**.

# Get Started with this Playbook Template

Kickstart your documentation processes by using this template as a guide. This template includes a ton of information on volunteer best practices. Edit what works for you, add pages and practices, and edit the style to fit your brand.

## Editing & Adding Pages

All pages are contained within the `content/playbook` folder. Each section of the Playbook has it's own folder containing a section title page and folders for each of that section's pages. The text content of each page is written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), and saved as `index.md`.

### Editing Pages

Each page (`index.md` within each page's folder) contains two parts.

The first is called frontmatter, and will look like this:

```
---
title: "Donâ€™t Assume Everyone Knows You"
section: "Day of Event"
sectionPage: "01"
page: "24"
published: true
type: child
---
```

Frontmatter is where you will edit the title that appears on the page, the section the page belongs in, the order (both in total pages and pages within the section), and whether the page is published or unpublished (must be either true or false). (Disregard and do not edit the type. This is for determining which pages are a section title page and which below within each section.)

The second part is the content of the page. This goes below the frontmatter and can be edited like normal text. To use headings, bolding, italics, lists, and images, refer to the [Markdown Guide's Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

### Adding New Pages

To add a new page, find the `***Page Template***` folder within `content/playbook`. Duplicate this folder into the section you wish to add the page to. Once duplicated, edit the name of the folder (we recommend adding the order number to the beginning). Make sure your folder name does **not** include spaces. From there, you can open the `index.md` file within your new folder and begin editing the page.

### Adding New Sections

To add a new section, find the `***Page Section***` folder within `content/playbook`. Duplicate this folder. It should automatically be placed within the `playbook` folder, but double check to make sure. Once duplicated, edit the name of the folder to be your new section (we recommend adding the order number to the beginning). Make sure your folder name does **not** include spaces. From there, you can open the `index.md` file within your new folder. Be sure to update the `sectionPage:` part of the frontmatter to whichever order you want this section to appear (we recommend starting with one more than your total sections. If you're starting from the base template, this would be 8). Then you can begin editing the rest of the page.

## Editing Colors & Fonts

To update the Playbook to match your own brand style, there are a few different things you can do.

### Colors

The easiest way to update the Playbook with your organization's brand colors is to get the primary color (in hex format). Open `src/styles/_theme.scss` and replace the color after `$brandColor:` at the top of the document (ex: `#3d7cff`).

If you wish to fine-tune your color selections, you can also edit any of the remaining colors in the `_theme.scss` document. Make sure you account for appropriate color contrast. You want to make sure people can read your document, after all!

### Fonts

Fonts are also specificed within the `src/styles/_theme.scss` file, but require extra work. The easiest way to replace fonts is to use Google Fonts. Find the name of the font you'd like to add, and replace `Inter` in the `gatsby-config.js` file (line 73). You can also specify the font weights on the same line. Then, in the `_theme.scss` file, replace `Inter` with the name of your font.

For more information on using Google Fonts with Gatsby, read the package page for [gatsby-plugin-google-fonts](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-google-fonts/).

## Replacing Images

The Playbook comes with default images created using [Open Peeps](https://www.openpeeps.com/). You can opt to replace these with your own images or illustrations.

### Logo

To add your own logo, replace the file `logo.png` located with the `content/assets` folder with an image of the same exact name (must be a `.png` file). Your image should be at least 80 pixels tall to preserve image quality.

### Cover Image

To replace the cover image on the homepage, replace the file `coverImage.png` (also within the `content/assets` folder) with an image of the same exact name (must be a `.png` file). This image should be fairly large (think at least 1500 pixels wide or larger).

### Section Hero Images

To replace each section's hero image, add an image to that section's folder (ex: `day-of-event`) and then replace the url for `coverImage: "peeps.png"`. (Here, peeps.png is the url). Make sure your url is surrounded in quotations.

### Inline Images

These can be added anywhere within the text using markdown. Refer to the [Markdown Guide's Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for more information.

## Deploying

_Note: Must have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started) & [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/) installed._

Deploying changes is as simple as running `yarn run deploy` from a terminal window. This automatically publishes changes to your forked github repo under a `gh-pages` branch. For more information on how GitHub Pages works, check out [their documentation](https://pages.github.com/).

## Technical Details

This Playbook was built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) with css modules.
